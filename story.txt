There once was a man named Bob, who lived in a small home with three cats. He worked as a construction worker during the day, but by night, he would put on his super suit to become the world's most notorious super villain: Evil Bob.
Evil Bob was known by everyone across the world due to all of the evil acts he committed. Some of the evil deeds includes blowing up Jupiter, draining all of the water from the Indian Ocean, and assassinating Brad Pitt. There was nothing that Bob couldn't do when he wore his super suit, he became what everyone dreamed they could do. However, one day a hero rose up to try and stop Evil Bob.
