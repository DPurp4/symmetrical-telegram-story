There once was a man named Bob, who lived in a small home with three cats. He worked as a construction worker during the day, but by night, he would put on his super suit to become the world's most notorious super villain: Evil Bob. Nobody knew that humble, simple Bob with his three cats was the same person as the villain terrorizing the neighborhood - and Bob liked it that way.
